    <h2>
      How does Uniswap work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a traditional exchange, traders place orders to be filled at a desired price. In Uniswap, traders buy or sell against a pool of tokens, where the price is determined by the amount of tokens in the pool, relative to the base asset (IE Ether).
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is the index?
    </h2>
    <p>
      An index tracks hypothetical investment performance of a given investment strategy. In Uniswap10, assets are weighted in proportion to market activity. The index value represents the hypothetical growth of 100 base units of currency (USD or Ether) since inception.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why track Uniswap?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since Uniswap is an Autonomous Market Maker rather than an order book exchange, liquidity and volume measurements are relatively straightforward. This allows creation of a market activity-weighted index.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How are liquidity and volume measured?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Liquidity for a given token is calculated by summing the token's pool balance (denominated in Ether) with the Ether balance of the pool. Volume is similarly a sum of traded tokens and ether. A 1-year average is used for each.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How are asset weights calculated?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each asset is ranked by 1-yr average liquidity and volume. The top 10 assets are then weighted by their proportion of total liquidity and volume.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How is the index rebalanced?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the rebalance period has passed (default 30 days) and the current asset weights are off by more than 1%, a rebalance occurs.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why are some liquid tokens not included?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of the assets on Uniswap are not intended as investments and are excluded, such as the
